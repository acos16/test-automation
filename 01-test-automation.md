##What is test automation?

Test automation is often described as the practice of using (automation) tools to run tests, work with test data, compare the actual results to the expected behavior amd report outcomes to the QA Engineer.

Automation uses technology to accomplish tasks with as little human interaction as possible.

Once automated tests are developed, they can be repeated and they can be extended to perform more complex scenarios.

For some people, saying **test automation** is controversial, 
others will prefer to say <em>testing that is assisted by automation</em>, 
or <em>checking</em> (see [checking vs testing](https://developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking)), 
or <em>automated qa testing</em> (see [testing vs quality assurance](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/quality-assurance-vs-testing)), 
or <em>scripted testing</em>,
plus numerous other ways which I have not mentioned here.

There is certainly a lot to be said and dissected on the matter. 

No matter how you choose to name it, I will refer to test automation as the act upon using different technology, tasks which assert certain behavior of the application under test, are accomplished: typically this will include scripts being developed, executed and maintained.

###<em>A more formal definition â€¦</em> <p>
Test automation is the use of specialized software to control the execution of tests, compare actual outcomes with expected outcomes, and report results. 

It involves creating scripts and utilizing tools to automatically conduct tests that were traditionally performed manually, aiming to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and coverage in the software testing process.

Test automation supports various types of testing, including unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and regression tests. It is particularly useful in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments, where frequent and fast testing cycles are critical.
