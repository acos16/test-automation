## What is test automation?

Test automation is often described as the practice of using (automation) tools to run tests, work with test data, compare the actual results to the expected behavior and report outcomes to the QA Engineer.

Automation uses technology to accomplish tasks with as little human interaction as possible.

Once automated tests are developed, they can be repeated and they can be extended to perform more complex scenarios.

The term **test automation** can sometimes be contentious, 
others will prefer phrases like <em>testing that is assisted by automation</em>, 
or <em>checking</em> (see [checking vs testing](https://developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking)), 
or <em>automated qa testing</em> (see [testing vs quality assurance](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/quality-assurance-vs-testing)), 
or <em>scripted testing</em>. There are many other terms that describe similar concepts, though not mentioned here.

Despite differing terminology, this guide will use **test automation** to refer to the process of using technology to perform tasks that verify specific behaviors of the application under test. This typically involves developing, executing, and maintaining scripts.

### <em>A more formal definition …</em> <p>
Test automation is the use of specialized software to control the execution of tests, compare actual outcomes with expected outcomes, and report results. 

It involves creating scripts and utilizing tools to automatically conduct tests that were traditionally performed manually, aiming to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and coverage in the software testing process.

Test automation supports various types of testing, including unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and regression tests. It is particularly useful in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments, where frequent and fast testing cycles are critical.


Automation testing involves having QA Engineers write test scripts to run the tests. When it comes to automation vs. manual testing, the main difference is based on who runs the test – human step-by-step or automation framework, along with other tools and software applications.
